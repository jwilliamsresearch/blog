### Introduction

You may have realissed while browsing this website that it has been recently updated from the version that I completed 3-years ago. The new website has been designed to enhance the presentation of research conducted and support more engaging overviews of my work. As part of this process, the website has undergone several improvements in technology and domain organisation. 

My history of updating my own website has been poor, however, over the last few months I have been slowly building a series of new interfaces for presenting my research publications, research projects, and an informal blog. The current interface was selected due to the organised view and easy to understand structure. 

This article will briefly present the current status of the website architecture, explaining the choices made and highlighting my future focus.
